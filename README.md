This full-stack project allows users to easily track their expenses, categorize them, and view an insightful summary of their spending habits. I developed the frontend using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a smooth and responsive interface, while the backend is powered by Python Flask to handle user data securely.

Here are some key features:

Expense Addition: Users can add new expenses with details like name, amount, and category.

Category Breakdown: A clear view of how money is spent across different categories.

Summary Page: An overview of total expenses and detailed category-wise breakdown.

I focused on building a user-friendly design with a clean UI that will look great on platforms like LinkedIn. This project helped me improve my skills in both frontend and backend development, and I'm thrilled with how it turned out!
